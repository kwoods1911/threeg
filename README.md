### How do I get set up? ###

* Requirements

	* First it is important that this project is located in the htdocs folder of your xampp folder.
	* In order to run this application you will need to install laravel and composer
	* Ensure you have Xampp installed on your machine.
	* Install composer - You can download composer here: https://getcomposer.org/
	* Then install laravel
	
	* Run Xampp and import the sql file located in the root of this folder. The file is called threeg_db
	* To run the project run the command php artisan serve
	* The project should then be running on http://localhost:8000/

	* If no records are being pulled from the database you may have to run the command "php artisan migrate" to create the tables in the database.
	
	

	* All of the code that I wrote will be available in two main locations which are:

	* C:\xampp\htdocs\cis-2261_woods_khari_threeg_shipping\app
	* C:\xampp\htdocs\cis-2261_woods_khari_threeg_shipping\resources\views
